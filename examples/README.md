The examples in this directory can be directly viewed in github or in your own jupyter notebook
environment. Some of the more involved notebook examples depend on sample data that are archived
with the regression tests. To retrieve those data, go to

`waketracking/reg_tests`

and run

`git submodule init && git submodule update`.
