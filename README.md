# SAMWICH Box
A Python-based toolbox for Simulated And Measured Wake Identification and CHaracterization

The notebooks in the `example` subdirectory are a good way to familiarize
yourself with the capabilities of SAMWICH Box, e.g.,
`examples/example_00_quick_start.ipynb`.

Note that the contour-based wake trackers depend on the `cv2` module from
the OpenCV Open Source Computer Vision Library.
